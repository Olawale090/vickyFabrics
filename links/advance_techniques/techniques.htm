                Colour theory
            </header>  
            <p>
                Colour is a fundamental element
in fashion design that can evoke
an emotional response but is also
determined by scientifi c principles.
The associations between colour and
light should be clearly understood
from the outset: in the absence of
light it is not possible to view colour.
So it follows that variations in light,
whether natural or man-made,
directly affect the way in which colour
is seen with the human eye. Moreover,
the human eye has the capacity to
distinguish between a vast range of
colour variations; these are generally
categorized into the main colours that
are visible through a prism, which is
known as the colour spectrum. 
            </p>
           
            <p>
                The colour wheel visually represents the
spectrum of electro-magnetic waves of
energy from infrared to ultraviolet as if
it was joined up in a circle or wheel. The
colours on the wheel can be described by
three main parameters: saturation, hue
and value. Saturation is used to describe
the intensity of a colour; it is also referred
to as chroma. A highly saturated colour
appears bright and is closer to the edge
of the colour wheel than an unsaturated
colour, which appears duller. A colour that
has no saturation or chroma will appear
as achromatic or in greyscale.

                Fibres
            </header>  
            <p>
                Fibre is the basic structural element
of a textile. It may be defi ned as any
substance with a high length-to-width
ratio that can be spun into a yarn
or made into a fabric by bonding or
interlacing in a variety of methods,
including weaving, knitting, felting,
twisting or braiding. Flax is considered
to be one of the oldest fi bres and
has been used in the production of
textiles since ancient times.
The classifi cation of fi bres is linked
to type, length and size. Type refers
to origin, such as whether a fi bre is
natural or man-made. Length refers to
the dimensions of the fi bre, of which
there are three main classifi cations:
short staple, long staple and
continuous fi lament. Size refers to
whether the fi bre is ultra-fi ne, fi ne,
regular or coarse. 
            </p>
           
            <p>
                Natural fi bres make up a large group of
textiles. This group includes any fi bre
that might be obtained from an animal,
vegetable or mineral source that is
capable of being converted into yarn.
Vegetable fi bres may be derived from
the trunk of a plant such as hemp palm;
fruit and nut shells such as coconut; bast
fi bres, which have been removed from the
stem of a plant such as linen, fl ax or jute;
and fi bres that are produced from the
seed of a plant, such as cotton. Cotton
and linen are the most important fi bres
used in fashion fabrics.

                Working with
sketchbooks
            </header>  
            <p>
                Sketchbooks are an essential
resource for a fashion designer
or a design student. They offer
fashion designers the opportunity to
record and organize their personal
thoughts, motivations and ambitions
over a period of time. At their
best, sketchbooks should provide
an unselfconscious record of a
designerâ€™s evolving vision and confi rm
their approach towards a defi ned
outcome or project. In this way,
they enable a designer to undertake
design research, critical enquiry
and investigation so that ideas are
explored and tested through a variety
of sketches, notes and additional
entries. Fashion sketchbooks that
have been tightly edited are generally
less effective in communicating an
idea and lack the freshness and vigour
that a sketchbook should offer. At its
most fundamental level a sketchbook
should present an appropriate
selection of sketches. These might
include visual analysis of silhouettes,
cut, shape, proportion and detailing.
Fashion designers sometimes
maintain sketchbooks in conjunction
with notebooks, visual diaries,
template books and technical fi les.
This approach can work for some
designers who prefer to separate
collections of fabric swatches and
magazine tearsheets or who like to
work outside a sketchbook on loose
sheets of paper.

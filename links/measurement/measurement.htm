        Sizing and measurements are
inextricably linked to a number of
processes in fashion design. Taking
a measurement is an important step
in creating a prototype sample in
the design studio; however, it should
not to be confused with sizing, which
has a broader role that includes
pattern grading and classifying
measurements for commercial
manufacturing and retailing. Attempts have been made to organize
the sizing of clothes into nationally
recognized values, such as the
National Sizing Survey in the UK and
the Department of Commerce in the
USA. International variations remain,
however. Europe, follows a metric system
whereas the USA is imperial. These
measurements form the basis of national
standard sizing systems, which are
subject to periodic sizing surveys. Size
surveys have shown that the average
male and female fi gure changes over
time and that measurements based on
the average woman during the 1950s
no longer refl ect the average size of a
woman today. When age, ethnicity and
lifestyle are factored in, it becomes
increasingly evident that sizing schemes
present national characteristics whilst
simultaneously evolving over time.
In the UK, the National Sizing Survey
utilized 3D whole body scanners to
produce accurate sizing data. Using
advanced technologies from Sizemic,
a London-based fashion technology
company, the survey involved taking
130 body measurements from 11,000
human subjects in standing and
seated positions. The results identifi ed
signifi cant body size variations from
previous recorded data.
Sizing can also be associated with
clothing sectors. Many casual clothing
lines are sized up as small, medium and
large; children’s clothes are sized by
age. Formal clothing, including business
suits for men and women are sized by
numeric ratios. In menswear it is common
practice to offer additional fi ttings across
the same size, such as short, regular
and long. Bespoke or custom-made
clothes, such as exclusive evening and
bridalwear might be individually sized to
a customer’s specifi cations. In this way,
we can also recognize that the sizing
of clothes is further affected by the
relationship between cut, fit and shape.

        From a fashion design perspective, a
        jacket may be cut to have a loose fi t
        or a slim fi t, but both could carry the
        same size label. While attempting to
        offer perspectives on sizing, fashion
        designers and design students are likely
        to work on a dress stand in a chosen
        sample size. This is usually a size 10
        or 12 in the UK and 8 or 10 in the US
        for women and a size 38 or 40 for
        menswear. Understanding how to take
        measurements is fundamental in the
        process of transferring an idea to a
        three-dimensional sample, either through
        a fl at pattern or draping process.
        Listed below are the main body
        measurements that are applied
        to womenswear:
         <li>Bust size</li> 
         <li>Waist size</li>
         <li>Hip size</li>
         <li>Nape of neck to waist or hip</li>
         <li>Waist to hip or knee</li>
         <li>Shoulder from the neck point</li>
         <li>Neck to wrist length</li>
         <li>Wrist</li>
         <li>Body rise for trousers (taken in the
        seated position)</li>
         <li>Front and back rise (for trousers/pants)</li>
         <li>Inside leg measurement</li>
         
        Most college design studios will have a
        set of dress stands and a corresponding
        set of pattern blocks, called slopers
        in the US, which correspond with the
        measurements of the dress stands.
        These ensure that the block will fi t the
        stand and allow the designer to work
        more effi ciently, without the need to
        make modifi cations to the block before
        using it to develop a fi rst sample.     </section>

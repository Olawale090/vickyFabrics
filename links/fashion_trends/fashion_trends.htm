        Drawing a fashion fi gure is one aspect of
fashion illustration. Planning the overall
layout and balance of the composition
is an important factor in effectively
communicating the overall look or
message of the artwork. In composition
the fashion fi gure represents the positive
image. The surrounding space is referred
to as the negative space. Both elements
should be carefully considered when
a fashion fi gure is placed on a page so
that the eye focuses on the main points
of interest without competing with an
overworked background. Unplanned
colours and superfl uous lines can detract
from, rather than complement a fashion
illustration, so less is more. Some of
the most effective fashion illustrations
allow the viewer to fi ll in details with the
mind’s eye.
An effective composition captures the
attention and interest of a viewer while
directing the eye to the intended focus
of the artwork; it should allow the eye
to fl ow logically over the supporting
elements of the image without creating
monotony or confusion. The selection
and use of colour is largely intuitive and a
matter of personal taste. A well-planned
fashion illustration will have an alluring
appeal that will draw in the viewer and
enhance the overall fi gure.

        Designers who approach fashion
        illustration do so with a training and
        a critical eye that compels them to
        communicate detailed information
        such as seam lines and individual
        pleats. Of course, this has its place
        in a designer’s portfolio and can
        produce a valid form of fi gurative
        illustration. However, if a design
        is clearly communicated through
        a fashion fl at or an equivalent
        line drawing, then some of the
        details of a design can be relaxed
        in an illustration to focus on
        communicating the spirit or attitude
        of an outfi t. Many of the techniques
        previously discussed in relation
        to fi gurative drawing can be readily
        applied to fashion illustration
        and combined with a level of
        personal expression.
        There is a rich variety in media
        choices for fashion illustration.
        Hand-drawing processes may be
        used on their own or in combination
        with CAD software. For a fashion
        design student or established
        practitioner an accomplished fashion
        illustration adds creative content
        to a design portfolio and is a good
        indication of the designer’s colour
        and compositional skills.     </section>

        In order to make use of the basic principles
        outlined in this chapter, it is important to
        know how to develop your thoughts on
        paper, to fully expand and explore an initial
        concept. The process of drawing and playing
        with your ideas records the thought process,
        but constant experimentation generates new
        ideas.
        After collecting your research and swatches
        of fabric and samples, a suitable Ӿ gure can
        be sketched. The pose and attitude of the
        model will have an impact on the designs
        that you illustrate. If the Ӿ gure is too
        stylized there is the possibility of getting the
        proportion wrong. If the Ӿ gure is too lifelike the design may lose its edge and sense
        of individuality, this ¶personal· approach
        helps to form the approach to the pattern
        cutting also.
        It·s customary to keep the idea as vivid and
        fresh as possible!
        This is one popular way of working:
Using a layout pad or similar translucent
paper, trace your design ideas over your
Ӿ gure template, varying the structure
scale and silhouette. This enables you to
concentrate on developing ideas rather than
drawing the Ӿ gure each time.
In order to choose your best ideas you need
to be critical but optimistic, be clear about
direction but original enough to experiment
with the unorthodox. Good ideas may
take some time to hatch, or it may take
time to get into a particular mind-set. For
example, when a new look emerges on the
street or from designer collections it may
challenge our pre-conceptions about what is
aesthetically pleasing and may look ¶wrong·.

        characteristics of fashion illustration
        were later recognized

        What passes for a fashion illustration
        today has evolved through the years,
        partly as a result of shifts and trends in
        society as well as through advances in
        computer technology and wider artistic
        and aesthetic cultural infl uences. In the
        same way that fashion design refl ects
        contemporary values and technologies,
        fashion illustration remains an evolving
        practice with artistic and commercial
        applications. Historically, fashion
        illustrations were featured in most
        fashion magazines until photography took
        over in the 1960s and 70s. The stylized
        characteristics of fashion illustration
        were later recognized and revived by
        some notable fashion magazines and
        commercial businesses in Europe and the
        United States. In reality, while fashion
        illustration and fashion photography are
        distinct media formats, the development
        of digital graphics software has boosted
        the artistic appeal of fashion illustration
        and extended its commercial reach.
        A hand-rendered fashion illustration has
        the capacity to present an image of the
        fashion fi gure that transcends what is
        real; it communicates what we might
        imagine or hope for. A fashion illustration
        should not only communicate visual
        information about a design but also
        express a mood or emotion: this remains
        one of the most important attributes of
        an effective illustration. Most of the great
        fashion illustrators, past and present,
        have understood this principle and
        worked with life models to enable a full
        range of expression in their work, such
        as Antonio Lopez in the 1970s as well as
        contemporary illustrators such as David
        Downton. It is interesting to note that
        many fashion illustrators are not usually
        trained designers. This is not a handicap
        but rather a release, which allows them to
        capture the essence and spirit of a design
        or outfi t without being distracted by too
        many details or constraints.     </section>

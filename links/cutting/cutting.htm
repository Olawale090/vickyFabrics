        Close examination of how fabric is manipu lated
        by cutting, drapi ng, and folding a l lows the
        designer to build subtle and dynamic elements
        into a design. Developing a lternative cutting
        strategies, wrapping the figure in soft folds,
        or designing systems of pleats, permits the
        designer to tran sform a ny silhouette.
        The role of the cutter in a design room seems
        simple enough-cut the p ieces-but it is a job
        that demands great precision and attention to
        deta il. How the garment is cut especially when
        using patterned fabrics like stripes, checks,
        and plaids can result in d ifferent appeara nces.
        Pieces can be cut on d ifferent gra ins or the bias
        for effect.
        There is a sensual ity i nvolved in d raping fa bric
        on and a round the body. The sari (or saree) is
        an ideal example of a garment that uses a rtful
        d raping. It is a length of fabric, approximately
        5 to 10 yards (4.6 to 9.1 m) in length, usually
        featuring an ornamental border. It is not cut or
        sewn in any way. The contemporary sari is worn
        over a choli (sari blouse) and a petticoat. It can
        be draped in a va riety of ways, but the N ivi style
        is the most popular.
        Scottish tartans were originally d raped in a
        fashion similar to the sari, cal led the G reat Kilt
        giving a soft toga-like appeara nce. The kilt has
        evolved over time to take on a more tai lored
        l ook, featuring precisely measured and perfectly
        pressed knife or box pleats. The modern kilt uses
        6 to 8 ya rds (5.5 to 7.3 m) of fab ric and can be
        pleated to set, which a lthough pleated, visually
        maintains the tartan repeat. A kilt can a lso be
        pleated to stri pe, a m ethod associated with ki lts
        for the military. A proper tartan is made of wool
        twill and m ust be identical in both directions of
        the warp and weft of the fabric. Methods that
        req uire an adherence to the kind of rigid rules
        involved in kilt-making cultivate a beauty only
        mathematics can provide.

        Any ga rment, from plain to intricate, will benefit
        from a sound infrastructure. Well-const ructed
        garments rely on many elements that are not
        apparent at first glance. Good workma nship will
        depend upon specific techniq ues and additional
        materials that best serve the design.
        Choosing the best seam for a project is conti ngent on the effect the designer is trying to
        ach ieve and the nature of the materials being
        used. Simple garments may use plain seams that
        can be fin ished with pi n king shears or overlock
        stitching to prevent unraveling. Bound seams a re
        finished with a strip of bias-cut fabric and are
        commonly found in unlined garments. A French
        seam is a seam within a seam, which works well
        with shear fa brics. Lapped or flat-fel led seams
        can be found on jeans and are used for their
        strength and durabil ity.
        Faci ngs are used to finish off areas such as
        a neckline or an a rm hole. Fusible and sew-in
        interfacings are found in facings, c uffs, col la rs,
        plackets, and buttonholes to add body, keep
        shape, and s uppo rt and reinforce an area.
        They a re ava i lable as woven, nonwoven, and
        knit materials.
        Lining is the ideal way to professionally fi nish a
        garment. I nterl i n ing is used between the l i ning
        and the garment to provide warmth, whereas
        underlining is used to a lter the hand (drape and
        feel ) o f t h e fabric, while a lso sta bilizi ng and
        strengthening it. I t c a n b e as l ight as organza or
        as rigid as buckram.
        Boning is a nother type of stabilizer a n d i s not
        restricted to use in corsets, bustiers, and strapless cresses. It can be used a long side seams to
        prevent saggi ng or as part of a neckline to avoid
        gaping. It can be appl ied to any a rea to prevent it
        from col lapsing and taking away from the design.
        Depending on the garment's design, there is
        a lways a logical o rder for its assembly. H ow it
        is assembled and fin ished also affects the final
        product. Which areas a re to be stitched? G l ued?
        Taped? Fused? Every choice takes the ga rment in
        a different d irection, m aking it truly unique to the
        designer who conceived of it.

    <section class="article">Sewing involves joining, assembling
        and stitching fabrics, as well as
        measuring, marking, cutting and
        pressing. Most fashion design
        students will be familiar with the
        term ‘press as you go’, which refers to
        pressing in conjunction with sewing.
        Sewing is a skilled operation with
        established rules and practices. As
        with most skills, it can be improved
        with practice and requires close
        attention and accuracy. In the fashion
        industry, many designers and design
        studios employ sample machinists
        to make a complete sample from cut
        work. Cut work is a design that has
        been cut out in fabric from a pattern
        and includes a specifi cation sheet
        or sketch from which the sample
        machinist can assemble the design.
        Fashion design students are usually
        expected to sew their own samples
        and will certainly learn from the
        experience. Most designers will not
        be required to commercially sew their
        own designs in industry, but they will
        need to oversee the process.Machine sewing involves operating an
        industrial or domestic sewing machine.
        All sewing machines need to be topthreaded to a spool, which is threaded
        through tension discs and on to a needle,
        and bottom-threaded on to a bobbin,
        which fi ts inside a bobbin case. The
        settings between the upper and lower
        threads should be established at the
        correct tension so that the stitches are
        evenly balanced in response to the foot
        pedal and feed dog when the fabric
        passes under the presser foot. Both
        threads pass under the presser foot in
        readiness to start the sewing operation.
        It is useful to familiarize yourself with the
        component parts of a sewing machine,
        then stitch a series of parallel lines in
        order to acquire the necessary ‘feel’
        and control of the machine. All sewing
        machines have their own feel but with
        practice they will respond to the operator.
        It is important to use a suitable needle
        for the type of fabric. Knitted fabrics
        such as jersey should be sewn with a
        ball-point needle while woven fabrics
        may be sewn with a sharp-point needle
        or extra fi ne-point needle. Sewing leather
        requires a leather needle, which has a
        sharpened triangular point. Needle sizes
        vary, so always check before you start to
        sew your fabric. As a guide, the fi ner the
        yarn, the fi ner the needle. Stitch lengths
        should also be considered in relation to
        the weight, structure and texture of the
        fabric. Threads should also be selected
        with care. Spun polyester threads are
        the most versatile but check before you
        sew. Embroidery and topstitching require
        different threads. Sewing machines are
        fi tted with a variety of sewing feet. These
        may need to be changed depending on
        the sewing operation but can include
        a zipper foot, buttonhole foot, felling
        foot, gather foot, Tefl on foot for sewing
        leather, tailor tacking foot, embroidery
        foot and a straight stitch foot. 
        This section of the tutorial attempts to explain
the process involved in making design
decisions; it is a complex process to unravel
due to changing contexts and a myriad of
individual approaches. Over the past thirty
years design research has emerged as a
distinct area of academic theory with many
accepted and emerging schools of thought;
the design processes discussed here have
been simplified but remain true to design
education and broad commercial practice.
Each of the elements below are discussed
as separate sections: Research, Design
development, Colour, Texture, Silhouette,
Proportion, Construction, Prototypes,
Embellishment and Specialist areas.
For the professional designer, commercial
and market constraints must be taken into
account. The brand manufacturer requires
garments that are economical to produce and
have mass appeal and volume sales, however,
it is now recognized that consumers require a
level of exclusivity and many companies now
produce limited ranges, as a consequence,
the designer must develop even more ranges
each season.
The fashion retailer depends on styles that
are eye catching and have instant ¶hanger
appeal·, they must be easy to get on and oӽ
and be attering to the gure of their market
demographic.
The consumer has demands on many levels, 
        
        <blockquote>
            Although the commercial designer has to consider all these issues, for the aspiring designer it is essential to explore your original ideas and experiment with the basic design principles to develop an appreciation of how all these individual elements work together to provide successful design solutions.

        from clothes worn not just as a statement
of current fashion trends but as a complex
series of non-verbal communications of
social status, sex appeal and conspicuous
consumption, to the more practical
considerations of utility, fit, value and ease
of care. The successful designer must please
everyone.
When considering a design brief, the market
area and price points are essential in deciding
the way in which your design development
will progress. It must look good - is it
aesthetically pleasing? Is it an appropriate
use of materials? Is it fit for the end purpose?
Is the range appealing to the market area and
can it be produced at the price dictated?
Although the commercial designer has to
consider all these issues, for the aspiring
designer it is essential to explore your
original ideas and experiment with the basic
design principles to develop an appreciation
of how all these individual elements work
together to provide successful design
solutions.
When approaching a design brief you can
logically break down the elements that have
to be considered, each one of these is part of
a decision making process and the wider your
source of reference and the more
experimental you are the more interesting
your design will be.
The main considerations are:

ANALYSIS OF THE DESIGN PROCESS
DESIGN BRIEF
RESEARCH
DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
PROTOTYPE
SOLUTION

DESIGN BRIEF
The design brief arises from the design
situation and creates parameters and
problems to be solved. A good design brief
should be formalized and clearly deӾ ne aims,
objectives and constraints. DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
Experimentation with shape, form, silhouette,
proportion, texture, pattern and colour.
Sampling of Ӿ nish, detail, seams and
embellishment.
Aesthetic considerations.
Two-dimensional planning of construction,
fastenings, performance and movement.
Fabrication; handle, drape, structure and
linings.RESEARCH
Collection of material from a wide range of
reference points.
Development of inspiration, themes,
colour, texture and sourcing materials and
fabrications.
Creative experimentation with ideas and
concept generation.
Investigation of sources of inspiration.
Trend and or market analysis.
Observations/drawing.PROTOTYPING
Three-dimensional translation of
construction, silhouette, proportion, cut,
drape, fastenings, performance, movement
and stretch.
Fabrication, handle, drape, structure and
linings. Fitting, balance and testing of the
Ӿ nal design.SOLUTION
Realization of the design, craftsmanship,
quality and Ӿ nish.
Perfecting Ӿ rst and second samples.
Manufacturing restrictions for production,
costs.
Evaluation, performance, sales and
merchandising.Every stage of the design process involves
drawing or graphic notation and being able
to eӽ ectively communicate each stage is part
of the skillset required
